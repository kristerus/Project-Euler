2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to n?


const smallestMult= n => {
   let inc = 2, step = 2 ,smallest = 2;
   
   while (smallest <= Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) {
        for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
          const divisible = smallest % i === 0;
          if (!divisible) {
            break;
          }
          if (i === inc) {
            step = smallest;
            inc++;
          }
          if (i === n) {
            return smallest;
          }
        }
        smallest += step;
      }
    }
smallestMult(20);
